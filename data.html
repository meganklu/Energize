          <h2 class="whyShould">Why change to sustainable and envrionmentally friendly energy? </h2>
          <br>
          <p class ="whyShould"> The use of combustion required energy sources known as fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas have proven to be extremely harmful to the planet. Combustion is the burning of a substance, which releases gases harmful to our atmosphere, otherwise known as <span class = "terms">CARBON EMMISSIONS</span>.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Decades of fossil fuel dependence, especially during the Industrial Revolutions, have left lasting effects on the planet, from polluting the air, oceans, and triggering rapid climate change we see today. Even today in the 21st century society on Earth, we are still heavily dependent on the use of fossil fuels and are inadvertently worsening the after effects of the past. Climate change has become the most prevalent issue on Earth, frequency of fires in Calfornia are increasing each year since the early 2010s, oceans are increasing in temperature, and weather behaviors are becoming erratic.

          <h2 class="whyShould">What are the financial impacts? </h2>
          <br>
          <p class ="whyShould"> Installation of renewable energy sources may seem like hefty investments, but prices for installing and using renewable energy sources, especially solar panels, have continuously reduced in price annually. In the long run, energy produced and government incentives for the public pay off the hefty investments made for renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources are cheaper compared to fossil fuels in the long run because it does not depend on natural resources such as coal. Natural resources are subject to scarcity and price fluctuations depending on the market and the sellers. Renewable energy sources solely depend on "free" natural resources, as in unregulated and beyond the control of people.

            <p class = "explanation">  Sun index is measured based on the ultraviolet light rays (UV). Altitude and the sun index share a direct relationship, as altitude increases, so does the sun index. In addition to altitude, the sun index increases as the distance from the equator reduces. The best areas have the most sun exposure and greatest sun index during the daytime and have the driest conditions. In addition to the sun index, areas with low humidty and light winds serve serve as the best envrionments for solar panels. </p>

High altitudes are home to stronger wind gusts, therefore providing the most efficent conditions for wind turbines. Hills should be free of infrastructure in order to reduce wind disruptions, as well as residential buildings as wind turbines produce sound throughout the day and contribute to sound pollution.
